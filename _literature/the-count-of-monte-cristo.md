### Thoughts
The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is my favorite book of all time. A good friend recommended it, and though it’s long, it’s an incredible read. Set in 19th-century Marseilles, France, around 1830, it’s a story of revenge and evil. Romantic in the broadest sense, it beautifully captures the charm of life in a coastal French town.

Highly recommend.
