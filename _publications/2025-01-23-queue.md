excerpt: "This study proposes a generalised macroscopic traffic simulation using a Mt/D/1/K queue to model congestion, using the Enniskillen to Belfast route as a case study. Empirical traffic data from Google's Directions API is used to calibrate the model, thus explaining peak commute times which we model using queue length."

This study proposes a generalised macroscopic traffic simulation using a Mt/D/1/K queue to model congestion, using the Enniskillen to Belfast route as a case study. Empirical traffic data from Google's Directions API is used to calibrate the model, thus explaining peak commute times which we model using queue length. Simulations of staggered institutional start times showed significant reductions in queue lengths, suggesting time based interventions to improve rural to urban traffic flow.
