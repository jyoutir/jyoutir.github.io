This repository contains my report and code on research conducted for Fermanah Community Transport, alongside my weekly portfolio of projects (PDFs + code) for my Stochastic Proccesses and Risk module, taught by Dr. Gareth Tribello at The Queenâ€™s University of Belfast.

Notably, for this module we were required to produce a weekly report exploring some concept learned in class (a very unique and formative form of assessment). Further, this contains the code for my research on using a M(t)/D/1/K macroscoping queueing model to propose affects of societal policies on reducing traffic/congestion.
