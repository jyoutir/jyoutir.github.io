<p>[E₁] Jyo created handmade clothing as a way for me to creatively express myself through art. I used traditional hand screenprinting (a dying craft) with modern cartoon designs of animals created with my friend Jessica Gawley to promote animal welfare. We secured a B2B deal with SociaLimit for 30 hoodies and £500 from The Queen’s University of Belfast’s Make it Happen Fund, and guidance from successful UK entrepreneurs Francesca Morelli and Helen Keys.</p>

<p>I stepped away to chase more technical and mathematical projects (after discovering coding) and help my cousin build Mayfair Rugs</p>
