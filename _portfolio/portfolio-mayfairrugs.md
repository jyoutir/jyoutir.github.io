<p>[E₂] Mayfair Rugs Global LTD exports hand-knotted rugs from India. My cousin, Aditya (aditya@mayfairrugs.co), oversees manufacturing in India and has built a strong client base across India.</p>

<p>My role was creating a legal presence in the UK and helping acquire international customers (UK/US interior designers, hotel groups, rug retailers).</p>

<p>I represented the brand at tradeshows, made cold-calls, attended meetings with directors of large retail firms, and oversaw technical details (reviewing the website, catalogues, email and social media campaigns, designs).</p>

<p>My current role is more relaxed, though I still join high-level discussions. In October 2024, we brought on Kanika Kushwaha to assist with UK marketing.</p>
