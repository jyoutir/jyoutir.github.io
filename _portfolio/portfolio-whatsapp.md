I could not find a data analysis tool for Whatsapp, so I created one myself. It runs completely locally, and takes seconds to use. 
Within Whatsapp, go to Settings > Data > Request Data > Select which chat you want to analyse > feed that data into the folder in the project and run. 

Outputs clean and efficient statistics.
