Numerous video-games have "community marketplaces" where players can trade their items, acting as a free economy. I hope to explain how these work, and thus started by creating a visualisation tool for the CS:GO market. 

I have personally invested hundreds of hours into this project as this is an extracirricular project on a topic I love. Thus, I hope to articulate my work through a series of blog posts:

I built this in collaboration with my childhood friend [Nukul Rajpoot](https://github.com/nukul-rajpoot), MSc Computer Science. <- Check out more of his projects here!
