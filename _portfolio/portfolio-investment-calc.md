Simple project which allows users to input saving habits and determine what results will look like in the long run. Created as a proof of concept to show my friend how powerful compound investing a little amounts over a long period of time can be. Personal favourite usecase is to simulate SNP500 returns over 20 years, always gets a good reaction.
