Miniprojects, Final Report, and code for my Numerical Analysis module, taught by Dr. Daniel Dundas at The Queen's University of Belfast. 

Topics of reports within the repo are centred on exploring numerical techniques on estimatinations used by algorythyms; notably I discussed Rhomberg Integration and Gauss-Jacobi quadrature in the Final Report for this module, which I spent 30+ hours researching.
