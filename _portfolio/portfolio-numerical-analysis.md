Academic projects; miniprojects, final report, and code for my Numerical Analysis module, taught by Dr. Daniel Dundas at The Queen's University of Belfast. 

Topics of reports are centred on exploring numerical techniques on estimatinations used by algorythyms; notably Rhomberg Integration and Gauss-Jacobi quadrature in the Final Report for this module.
