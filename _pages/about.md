## Who I am, what I do, and where I‚Äôm going

Hi, I‚Äôm a Mathematics student in the UK. I love maths and coding. 
I spend most of my time solving problems and trying to create solutions that help people.
Otherwise I like to read, cook, play piano, climb and make delicious coffee. 

When I retire, I want to run a coffee bean roastery. Maybe philosophise like the romans ü§ì ‚òùÔ∏è. Raise a cat.
Until then, I hope to keep my childish curiosity and love for reading alive, and continue making what excites.


## Website Structure

- Publications: Academic work. Papers I have written/co-written [P‚ÇÅ, P‚ÇÇ, ..., P‚Çô], or been acknowledged in [A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ, ..., A‚Çô].
- Portfolio: Mainly maths or coding projects. Websites, analysis tools, apps, affiliated academic work [I‚ÇÅ, I‚ÇÇ, ..., I‚Çô]. Traditional entrepenurial work is denoted as [E‚ÇÅ, E‚ÇÇ, ..., E‚Çô]
- Literature: Book reviews, exploring research, occasional personal writing [L‚ÇÅ, L‚ÇÇ, ..., L‚Çô].
