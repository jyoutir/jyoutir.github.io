## Who I am, what I do, and where I'm going

I'm a Mathematics student in the UK. I love maths and coding. 
I spend most of my time solving problems and trying to create solutions people might use.
Otherwise I like to read, cook, play piano, write, climb and make yummy coffee. 

I hope to solve problems for people, do maths, and code until im 100.  Above all I will continue reading, researching, and continue making what excites.
