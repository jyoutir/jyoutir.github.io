## Who I am, what I do, and where I'm going

I'm a Mathematics student in the UK. I love maths and coding ü§ì ‚òùÔ∏è. 
I spend most of my time solving problems and trying to create solutions that people might like.
Otherwise I like to read, cook, play piano, write, climb and make yummy coffee. 

I will solve problems for people, do maths, and code until im 100. Maybe learn to roast coffee and start a roastery or raise a cat. 
Above everything I'll continue reading, researching, and continue making what excites.
