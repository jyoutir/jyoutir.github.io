## Who I am, what I do, and where I'm going

I'm a Mathematics student in the UK. I love maths and coding. 
I spend most of my time solving problems and trying to create solutions that help people.
Otherwise I like to read, cook, play piano, climb and make delicious coffee. 

When I retire, I want to run a coffee bean roastery. Maybe philosophise like the Romans ü§ì ‚òùÔ∏è. Raise a cat.
Until then, I hope to keep my curiosity and love for reading and research alive, continuing to make what excites.
